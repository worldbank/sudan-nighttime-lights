# Sudan Nighttime Lights - Key Visualizations

This gallery showcases the main visualizations and findings from the Sudan nighttime lights analysis.

## Interactive Maps

### Nighttime Lights Distribution
The interactive map shows the spatial distribution of nighttime lights across Sudan, highlighting urban centers and economic activity patterns.

### Gas Flaring Locations
Integration of gas flaring data helps separate industrial lighting from urban activity.

## Time Series Analysis

### Monthly Trends
Analysis of nighttime lights over time reveals seasonal patterns and long-term trends.

### State-Level Comparison
Comparison of nighttime lights intensity across Sudan's different states.

## Administrative Analysis

### Locality-Level Patterns
Detailed breakdown of nighttime lights at the locality level for fine-grained analysis.

### Urban vs Rural Distribution
Contrast between urban centers and rural areas in terms of nighttime lights intensity.

## Data Sources and Methodology

- **VIIRS Black Marble**: Monthly composites from NASA
- **Administrative Boundaries**: GADM Level 1 and 2 boundaries
- **Gas Flaring Data**: NOAA detection dataset
- **Analysis Period**: 2012-2023

## Key Findings

1. **Urban Concentration**: Major cities show highest nighttime lights intensity
2. **Seasonal Variation**: Clear seasonal patterns in rural areas
3. **Gas Flaring Impact**: Significant contribution from industrial sources
4. **Regional Disparities**: Uneven distribution across states
