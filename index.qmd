# Sudan Nighttime Lights Analysis

This project analyzes nighttime lights data for Sudan using NASA's VIIRS Black Marble dataset. The analysis provides insights into economic activity, urbanization patterns, and infrastructure development across Sudan.

## Overview

The analysis includes:

- **Data Collection**: Processing VIIRS Black Marble nighttime lights data
- **Spatial Analysis**: Examining patterns across Sudan's administrative boundaries
- **Gas Flaring Integration**: Incorporating gas flaring data to separate industrial activity
- **Interactive Visualization**: Creating maps and charts to explore the data

## Key Features

- Monthly nighttime lights data from 2012-2023
- Administrative boundary analysis at state and locality levels
- Gas flaring data integration
- Interactive leaflet maps
- Statistical summaries and trends
