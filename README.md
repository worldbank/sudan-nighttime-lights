The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> is a standardized, but flexible *project* and *documentation* structure of folders and files for sharing your data science work.

Inspired by [literate programming](http://literateprogramming.com), maintained by the [Development Data Group](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/unit-dec/dev) and built as [GitHub template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), the <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> contains:

- [**README**](README), [**CODE_OF_CONDUCT**](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [**CONTRIBUTING**](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) templates
    > README files are important and often neglected. The files should inform anyone about the first steps to use, learn and contribute to your project.

- [**CITATION.cff**](CITATION.cff)
  > Embracing [CFF](https://citation-file-format.github.io) aligns with best practices for reproducible research and software development. By adhering to established standards for documenting project dependencies and citations, we demonstrate our commitment to quality, transparency, and integrity in our work.

- [**LICENSE**](LICENSE)
  > The LICENSE is a document that  determines what others can and cannot do with contents of the repository. If no license is present, no one has permission to use and/or modify your code. The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> is licensed under the [**Mozilla Public License**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/). And so will projects generated from it. For further information, see also [this discussion](https://github.com/orgs/worldbank/discussions/4).

- **docs/**

    > Documentation is often never prioritized until last minute. The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> aims to revert the malpractice by setting up the documentation as an integral part, inspired by [literate programming](http://literateprogramming.com). With the power of [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org), data practitioners have a way to share [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) in a standardized and effortless way.

- [**docs/bibliography.bib**](/docs/bibliography.bib)
    > A `bibliography` using the [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.org/Format/) format. Use this file to include and cite your project's bibliography. See also [Citations and bibliographies](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/citations.html).

- **data/**
    > Placeholder folder for data. Data is immutable. By default, the data folder is present but ignored from version control, in order to prevent files of being mistakenly versioned in the code repository.

- **src/**
    > Placeholder folder for source code. If Python, it is recommended the package is made pip-installable.

- **notebooks/**
    > Placeholder folder for [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org). Markdown files and Jupyter notebooks can be added to `docs/_toc.yml` (Table of Contents) to compose the *documentation*.

- [**.pre-commit-config.yml**](https://github.com/worldbank/template/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml)
    > Using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) offers a significant advantage in streamlining the development process by enforcing code standards and reducing errors before code reaches the review stage or is committed to the repository. It automates the execution of various checks, such as syntax errors, code formatting, and ensuring compliance with coding standards, which saves time and improves code quality.

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot)
    > [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) are two powerful features provided by [GitHub](https://github.com) to automate and secure software development workflows, making it easier for developers to maintain high-quality and safe codebases.

- [GitHub Issues and Pull Requests GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)
    > GitHub allows to customize how issues and pull requests are presented to the public. Custom templates encourage collaboration and maintainability.

````

### Add content

The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> is created as a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) - an open-source project to build beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational content. Let's see below how to add, execute and publish new content for your project.

#### Updating the Jupyter Book `_config.yml` metadata

To configure your Jupyter Book for your project, you‚Äôll need to update the `_config.yml` file. This file controls various aspects of the Jupyter Book, including the project title, description, and relevant URLs. Below is a template to update this file to reflect the project‚Äôs details.

```yaml
# Book settings
title: <your-project-title>
author: <your-team>

repository:
url: https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-project>

# Jupyter Book options
execute:
  execute_notebooks: "auto"  #  Automatically execute notebooks during the build process
```

#### Update table of contents

When ready to publish the *documentation* on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), all you need to do is edit the [table of contents](https://github.com/worldbank/template/blob/main/docs/_toc.yml) and add and/or update content you would like to display. [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) supports content written as [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks and [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) files and the `docs/_toc.yml` file controls the [table of contents](https://github.com/worldbank/template/blob/main/docs/_toc.yml) of your book.

The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> comes with the [table of contents](https://github.com/worldbank/template/blob/main/docs/_toc.yml) below as an example.

```yaml

format: jb-book
root: README

parts:

  - caption: Examples
    numbered: True
    chapters:
      - file: notebooks/world-bank-api.ipynb
      - file: notebooks/world-bank-package.ipynb
      - file: notebooks/nasa-apod.ipynb
      - file: notebooks/bibliography.ipynb
```

```{seealso}
[Jupyter Book Structure and organize content](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/basics/organize.html)
```

#### Add executable content

[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) can be beautifully rendered and downloaded from your book. By default, the <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> will render any files listed on the [table of contents](#update-table-of-contents) that have a notebook structure. The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> comes with a Jupyter notebook example, `notebooks/world-bank-api.ipynb`, to illustrate.

```{important}

By default, Jupyter notebooks are **not** executed. However, you can configure[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) to run notebooks during the build process (on GitHub), allowing **code outputs** and **interactive visualizations** to be generated and included in the *documentation* automatically. When enabled, Jupyter notebooks are executed by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) each time a commit is made to the `main` branch. For this to work, it‚Äôs crucial to ensure that all necessary [dependencies](##use-pyproject-toml-for-python-package-management) are included in the repository. If you want to prevent a specific notebook from being executed, you can [exclude it from execution](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/execute.html#exclude-files-from-execution).
```

```

#### Distributing Your Project as a Python Package

If your project uses [Python](https://python.org), it‚Äôs highly recommended to distribute it as a [package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/). By including a `pyproject.toml` file, the packaging process becomes more streamlined - *trust me [things can get intense](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png)*.

Additionally:

```{tip}
- Using `pyproject.toml` future-proofs your setup by aligning with modern packaging standards.
- The `pyproject.toml` file acts as a single source of truth for your Python dependencies and project metadata.
- You can combine Conda for system-level dependencies with `pyproject.toml` for Python dependencies, using Conda for environments and pip/poetry for Python packages.
- Any packages in the `src/` folder will be automatically discovered and installed.
```

##### Use `pyproject.toml` for Python Package Management

While the <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> recommends using [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) (or [Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba)) as the environment manager and managing dependencies through an `environment.yml` file, there is an alternative approach that leverages `pyproject.toml`. This can be particularly advantageous if your project is a Python package or if you want to simplify and standardize the management of Python-specific dependencies.

##### Why use `pyproject.toml`?

The next step is ensure your code is maintainable, reliable and reproducible by including
any dependencies and requirements, such as packages, configurations, secrets (template) and additional instructions.

1. **Standardization**: `pyproject.toml` is a modern, standardized format defined by [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) and [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) that centralizes project configuration in Python projects, including build requirements and dependencies.

2. **Python Packaging**: If your project is to be distributed as a package, `pyproject.toml` is the preferred way to define build tools (like [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/dependency/) or [poetry](https://python-poetry.org)) and metadata for your package (like name, version, dependencies, etc.). It allows tools like `pip` and `build` to install and package your project more effectively.

3. **Compatibility with Tools**: The `pyproject.toml` file is compatible with multiple Python packaging and dependency management tools such as `poetry` and `pip`. This allows for smoother integration with CI/CD pipelines, PyPI, and other environments.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: While Conda manages both system-level and Python-specific packages, using `pyproject.toml` helps isolate Python dependencies. This is useful if your project uses primarily Python packages and you want finer control over Python versioning and dependency resolution.

#### Example: Using `pyproject.toml`

This `pyproject.toml` file specifies the dependencies and other metadata for your Python package. You can install these packages using `pip`, ensuring that your Python environment is properly managed. You can still use Conda for system-level packages (such as `libc`, `gdal`, etc.), while using `pyproject.toml` for Python package management.

1. **`pyproject.toml` Example**:

    ```toml
    [build-system]
    requires = ["hatchling>=1.21.0", "hatch-vcs>=0.3.0"]
    build-backend = "hatchling.build"

    [project]
    name = "template"
    description = "A data science project"
    readme = { file = "README.md", content-type = "text/markdown" }
    license = { file = "LICENSE" }
    authors = [
      { name = "Your Name", email = "your.email@example.com" }
    ]
    dynamic = ["version"]

    python = ">=3.9"
    dependencies = [
      "pandas>=1.4.3,<2",
    ]
    [project.optional-dependencies]
    docs = [
        "docutils==0.17.1",
        "jupyter-book>=1,<2",
    ]

    [tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]
    include = [
        "src/**/*"
    ]

    [tool.hatch.version]
    source = "vcs"
    ```

2. **Keep the Conda Environment for System-level Packages**:
    You can continue to use `environment.yml` to specify non-Python dependencies or packages not available on PyPI, such as `mamba` or `gdal`.

    ```yaml
    channels:
      - conda-forge
    dependencies:
      - python=3.9
      - mamba
      - gdal
    ```

3. **Installation**:
  To create an environment, you would first install the Conda dependencies and then use `pip` to install Python-specific dependencies from `pyproject.toml`. Alternatively, you can skip Conda and use `pip` for the entire setup.

    ```shell
    # Create Conda environment
    conda env create -f environment.yml -n <your-environment-name>

    # Activate the environment
    conda activate <your-environment-name>

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install .
    ```

  To install a Python package directly from a [GitHub](https://github.com) repository using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/), you can use the command pip install `git+https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git`. This allows you to install the latest version of the package from the repository. You can also specify a particular branch or release tag by adding `@<branch_or_tag>` at the end of the URL This is particularly useful when you want to access features or fixes that haven‚Äôt been published on PyPI yet, or to get the latest updates from the repository.

  If you want to install the latest release, you should specify the tag associated with that release. For instance:

  ```shell
    pip install git+https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git@<latest_release_tag>
  ```
