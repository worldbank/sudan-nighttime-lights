# Sudan Poverty Trends and Economic Monitoring

## Assignment

The East Africa Poverty Team fhas requested support for using alternative data to better understand poverty and economic trends in Sudan and South Sudan.

The assignment covers analytics of crop productivity, conflict mapping, flood mapping, analyzing internet connectivity trends, monitoring nighttime lights, and analyzing urban expansion trends.

## Data

The following datasets are used in this assignment:

* [ACLED](https://worldbank.github.io/iraq-economic-monitoring/docs/2-data.html#(https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/int/search/dataset/0061835/acled---middle-east)) - Time-stamped, geolocated points where conflicts (protests, attacks, etc.) have occured, collected globally based on news and crowdsourced data.

* [BlackMarble](http://blackmarble.gsfc.nasa.gov/) - Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nighttime Lights from NASA.

* [Eurpean Space Agency Sentinel I](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/overview)  - The Sentinel-1 constellation provides continuous all-weather, day-and-night imagery, with global geographical coverage and rapid data dissemination to support applications in marine monitoring, land monitoring and emergency services. The team uses Synthetic Aperature Radar (SAR) data generated by the consetllation to detect changes in the height and shape of surface features over time. 

* [Digital Earth Africa Cropland Extent Map](https://www.digitalearthafrica.org/platform-resources/services/cropland-extent-map) - The service shows the presence or absence of crop for a 10-meter pixel resolution.

* [MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/) - NASA's 'Modern Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer' dataset, used to monitor changes in surface vegetation. 

* [Ookla Speedtest Intelligence](https://docs.datapartnership.org/partners/ookla/README.html) - Internet connectivity maps. Quarterly data at a subnational level is available publicly and more temporally and spatially granular datasets can be accessed through the  [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/).

* [GSMA Connectivity Index](https://www.mobileconnectivityindex.com/index.html) - Measurement of the performance of 173 countries – representing 99% of the global population – against key enablers of mobile internet adoption: infrastructure, affordability, consumer readiness, and content and service.

* [NASA LANCE](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data/near-real-time/hazards-and-disasters/floods) - NASA LANCE near real-time data can be used for identifying, tracking, and mapping floodwater extent for active floods.

Additional details about each dataset—such as licensing, update frequency, and access instructions—are provided within the respective data products.
